<sup>If you're looking for modding (not addons), then use [gdmod](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdmod) instead of this.</sup>

Adds functionality for loading & deleting of addons. Each addon has a `Name` and a `Source` code, these are defined when
the addon is first loaded. To run your addons, just add `Execute (all) addons` action into a separate event.

# How to use

I'll update this part later...

# Making addons

1. First of all, you need to have a name for your addon (this doesn't really matter, it's just used for accessing the addon later, for example when deleting)
2. The second thing you need to add when loading the addon is the `Source`, this is basically the code the addon will run. Websites i recommend when writing in Javascript for Gdevelop 5 are the [gdjs documentation](https://docs.gdevelop.io/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation/) and the [wiki](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/events/js-code/) (which has the basics)
